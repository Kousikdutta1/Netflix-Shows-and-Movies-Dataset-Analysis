# Netflix-Shows-and-Movies-Dataset-Analysis
Introduction : 
Analyzing different aspects of Netflix Movies and TV shows with the help of Exploratory data analysis.

1. Data Cleaning: I have done data cleaning operations on raw data as there were null values.

2. Data Wrangling: After cleaning data some transformation has also been done for records (Changing Data Types, filling null values ) after which I was able to analyze data more accurately.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: After Visualizing various aspects of the dataset, I have arrived at multiple
conclusions :
 ● The most popular content type on Netflix is movies.
 ● The most number of Movies and TV Shows are produced by the United States followed by India, which has produced the second most number of Movies on NETFLIX. Now we have also seen that in the case of Movie content on the NETFLIX United States followed by India at the top, but if we say about TV Show then the most numbers of TV Show content are produced by the United States followed by the United Kingdom.
 ● Netflix started gaining ground in 2014 and has been significantly increasing its content portfolio ever since.
 ● The largest count of Netflix content is made with a “TV-MA” rating ( Mature Audience Only).
 ● The top 3 directors whose work features the most on NETFLIX are Rajiv Chilaka, Jan Suter, and Raul Campos.
 ● There was a steady rise in content production over the years till about 2019 when the content dipped. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the entertainment industry particularly hard during that period.
 ● International Movies and Dramas are the most popular Genres on NETFLIX.
 ● We can also see that the duration for Netflix movies closely resembles a normal distribution with the average viewing time spanning about 90 minutes which seems to make sense. Netflix TV shows on the other hand seem to be heavily skewed to the right where the majority of shows only have 1 season.
